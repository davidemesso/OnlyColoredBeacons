# OnlyColoredBeacons

Minecraft resource pack to make only colored beacon beams appear.

### Why

If you want to spam beacons all around your world, having buff everywhere, but you dont want the beams to ruin your eyes and your landscape this is the resourcepack for you.
Just disabling default beams, but if you want to have them back you just have to color them, so they will appear as in vanilla minecraft.
You can also play with colors and have a colored beam that disappears after some blocks applying some white glasses.

### How to install

Just put the main folder inside your resourcepacks folder in .minecraft, and the pack will appear in game menu.
